# **Cleankit**

Cleankit is a lightweight and efficient command-line tool that helps developers quickly clean boilerplate code and customize metadata (such as title and description) for **React**, **Next.js**, and **Remix** projects. Designed to save time, Cleankit works with a single command to organize projects after downloading a framework or library. It automates the removal of unnecessary files and code, making it faster and easier than manual cleanup, so developers can focus on building features instead of setting up the basics.
